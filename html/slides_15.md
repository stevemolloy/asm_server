# What have we learned?

Assembly is easier than I thought.  Very very difficult.  But easier than I had assumed

Dealing with assembly makes you concentrate on important things.  For example, imagine trying to parse a large file -- the extreme manual way of working will force you to concentrate on only extracting the information you need.

Learning assembly is for learning more about computers, OS's, and programming.  Not for creating projects.

Given what you have seen, can you imagine the complexity of a text editor, web server, physics calculation, etc.?
